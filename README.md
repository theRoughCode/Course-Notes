# Course-Notes
Hey everyone!  This repo was created initially for me to study/increase the lifespan and legacy of my notes.  However, I realized that I could go further and make this open-source.  So, here it is!

3. If you're creating a new course, create a new file "courses/\<subject in lower-case\>\<course-number\>.html"
4. Implement your feature.  Don't be afraid to ask questions!
5. Once you've finished implementing your changes, make sure that your master branch is up-to-date with the remote master branch

## What Should I Take Note Of?
### Math-Related Courses
For math-related courses, we will be making use of [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to embed LaTeX into our html.  
If you are creating a new html file that requires MathJax, include the following script tags into the \<head\> of your document.
```html
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.0/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
  MathJax.Hub.Config({
    tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']]}
  });
</script>
```
#### Tips for MathJax
 - To in-line LaTeX: use $\<math\>$
 - To centre on page (equation-style): use $$\<math\>$$
### CS-Related Courses
For CS-related courses, we will be using Google's [Code-Prettify](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) to format and provide syntax highlighting for our code.  To embed it in your code, use either ```<pre>``` or ```<code>``` with ```class="prettyprint"``` and enclose your code segment in it.
